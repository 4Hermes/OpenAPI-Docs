    Handles the majority of what **Project Hermes** is capable of. For example, it provides endpoints that manage the CRUD operations for _Users_ and _Friends_, as well as an endpoint for _Check Ins_.

    A _Check In_ is an event where a User is generating a message to send to their Friend and all that work is done by this API.
